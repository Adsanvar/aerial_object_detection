# Aerial Object Detection
Creating an algorithm to classify objects from a top down aerial view supplied with google maps or a drone live feed.

### Purpose
Assist companies in estimation and tracking for different occasions such as:
- Roof size estimation
- Lawn size coverage
- Shortest path between two points after classifying objects that reduce mobility.

### Objectives
- Vehicle(s)
  - Gather sampling data from Google Maps for model training.
  - Construct a basic algorithm with K-means Clustering.
  
### Strategy
- Dectect certain objects inside frame
  - Crop those objects for futher analysis
